    Peristimulus time histogram

    The single trial input `trl_dat` needs 3 columns:
        - 1st: the sample numbers of the spikes
        - 2nd: channel number of each spike
        - 3rd: unit number of each spike (set to constant if not available)

    Parameters
    ----------
    trl_dat : :class:`~np.ndarray`
        Single trial spike data with shape (nEvents x 3)
    trl_start : int
        Start of the trial in sample units
    onset : int
        Trigger onset in samples units
    trl_end : int
        End of the trial in sample units
    chan_unit_combs : :class:`~np.ndarray`
        All (sorted) numeric channel-unit combinations to bin for
        arangend in a (N, 2) shaped array, where each row is
        one unique combination (say [4, 1] for channel4 - unit1)
        If `None` will infer from the supplied SpikeData array.
    tbins: :class:`~numpy.array` or None
        An array of monotonically increasing PSTH bin edges
        in seconds including the rightmost edge
        Defaults with `None` to the Rice rule
    output : {'rate', 'spikecount', 'proportion'}, optional
        Set to `'rate'` to convert the output to firing rates (spikes/sec),
        'spikecount' to count the number spikes per trial or
        'proportion' to normalize the area under the PSTH to 1
        Defaults to `'rate'`
    samplerate : float
        Samplerate in Hz

    Returns
    -------
    counts : :class:`~np.ndarray`
        Spike counts for each available channelX_unitY
        combination with shape (nBins, nChannelUnits)
