    """
    Single trial Fourier cross spectral estimates between all channels
    of the input data. First all the individual Fourier transforms
    are calculated via a (multi-)tapered FFT, then the pairwise
    cross-spectra are computed.

    Averaging over tapers is done implicitly
    for multi-taper analysis with `taper="dpss"`.

    Output consists of all (nChannels x nChannels+1)/2 different complex
    estimates arranged in a symmetric fashion (``CS_ij == CS_ji*``). The
    elements on the main diagonal (`CS_ii`) are the (real) auto-spectra.

    This is NOT the same as what is commonly referred to as
    "cross spectral density" as there is no (time) averaging!!
    Multi-tapering alone is not necessarily sufficient to get enough
    statitstical power for a robust csd estimate. Yet for completeness
    and testing the option `norm=True` will output a single-trial
    coherence estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trl_dat : (K, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Uniformly sampled multi-channel time-series data
        The 1st dimension is interpreted as the time axis,
        columns represent individual channels.
        Dimensions can be transposed to `(N, K)` with the `timeAxis` parameter.
    samplerate : float
        Samplerate in Hz
    nSamples : int or None
        Absolute length of the (potentially to be padded) signal or
        `None` for no padding
    foi : 1D :class:`numpy.ndarray` or None, optional
        Frequencies of interest  (Hz) for output. If desired frequencies
        cannot be matched exactly the closest possible frequencies (respecting
        data length and padding) are used.
    taper : str or None
        Taper function to use, one of scipy.signal.windows
        Set to `None` for no tapering.
    taper_opt : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments passed to the `taper` function.
        For multi-tapering with `taper='dpss'` set the keys
        `'Kmax'` and `'NW'`.
        For further details, please refer to the
        `SciPy docs <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.windows.html>`_
    demean_taper : bool
        Set to `True` to perform de-meaning after tapering
    polyremoval : int or None
        Order of polynomial used for de-trending data in the time domain prior
        to spectral analysis. A value of 0 corresponds to subtracting the mean
        ("de-meaning"), ``polyremoval = 1`` removes linear trends (subtracting the
        least squares fit of a linear polynomial).
        If `polyremoval` is `None`, no de-trending is performed.
    timeAxis : int, optional
        Index of running time axis in `trl_dat` (0 or 1)
    noCompute : bool
        Preprocessing flag. If `True`, do not perform actual calculation but
        instead return expected shape and :class:`numpy.dtype` of output
        array.

    Returns
    -------
    CS_ij : (1, nFreq, N, N) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Complex cross spectra for all channel combinations ``i,j``.
        `N` corresponds to number of input channels.

    Notes
    -----
    This method is intended to be used as
    :meth:`~syncopy.shared.computational_routine.ComputationalRoutine.computeFunction`
    inside a :class:`~syncopy.shared.computational_routine.ComputationalRoutine`.
    Thus, input parameters are presumed to be forwarded from a parent metafunction.
    Consequently, this function does **not** perform any error checking and operates
    under the assumption that all inputs have been externally validated and cross-checked.
