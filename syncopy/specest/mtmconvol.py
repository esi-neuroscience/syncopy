    """
    (Multi-)tapered short time fast Fourier transform. Returns
    full complex Fourier transform for each taper.
    Multi-tapering only supported with Slepian windwows (`taper="dpss"`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_arr : (N,) :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Uniformly sampled multi-channel time-series data
        The 1st dimension is interpreted as the time axis
    samplerate : float
        Samplerate in Hz
    nperseg : int
        Sliding window size in sample units
    noverlap : int
        Overlap between consecutive windows, set to ``nperseg - 1``
        to cover the whole signal
    taper : str or None
        Taper function to use, one of `scipy.signal.windows`
        Set to `None` for no tapering.
    taper_opt : dict
        Additional keyword arguments passed to the `taper` function.
        For multi-tapering with ``taper='dpss'`` set the keys
        `'Kmax'` and `'NW'`.
        For further details, please refer to the
        `SciPy docs <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.windows.html>`_
    boundary : str or None
        Wether or not to auto-pad the signal such that a window is centered on each
        sample. If set to `None` half the window size (`nperseg`) will be lost
        on each side of the signal. Defaults `'zeros'`, for zero padding extension.
    padded : bool
        Additional padding in case ``noverlap != nperseg - 1`` to fit an integer number
        of windows.

    Returns
    -------
    ftr : 4D :class:`numpy.ndarray`
         The Fourier transforms, complex output has shape:
         ``(nTime, nTapers x nFreq x nChannels)``
    freqs : 1D :class:`numpy.ndarray`
         Array of Fourier frequencies

    Notes
    -----
    For a (MTM) power spectral estimate average the absolute squared
    transforms across tapers:

    ``Sxx = np.real(ftr * ftr.conj()).mean(axis=0)``

    The STFT result is normalized such that this yields the power
    spectral density. For a clean harmonic and a frequency bin
    width of `dF` this will give a peak power of `A**2 / 2 * dF`,
    with `A` as harmonic ampltiude.
