This shows us the following properties of the coherence:

* **symmetry**: the coherence of channel pair 1-2 is the same as 2-1
* **range**: like correlations, the coherence measure lives on the [0,1] interval
* **sensitivity**: even though both channels have a lot of power around 100Hz, coherence is as low as for all other frequencies as there is no coupling
